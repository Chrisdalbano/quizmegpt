# A Quiz App based on chat-gpt API 

QuizMEGPT is an interactive web application that generates quizzes for you based on the topic of your choice. It utilizes the power of OpenAI's advanced language model, chat-gpt-turbo, to process your requests and provide insightful, challenging, and fun quizzes in return.

Here's how it works:
Choose Your Topic: Just enter a topic you're interested in, and QuizMEGPT will use it to create a quiz. The more specific you are with your topic, the more targeted the quiz will be.
Select Difficulty Level: You can choose the difficulty level of your quiz from easy, medium, hard, to emojis. The higher the level, the more challenging the questions! And let's not talk about the emojies difficulty...
Quiz Generation: After you've chosen a topic and difficulty, click on 'Generate Quiz'. The application will then send a request to the OpenAI API. The API's response will be processed and formatted through specific algorithms to generate a unique and engaging quiz for you.
Account Benefits: If you have an account and are logged in, you can track your progress, review past quizzes, and even earn points from your quiz results! As you accumulate points, you'll level up and unlock new titles, adding an exciting competitive edge to your quizzing journey.
Load Sample Quiz: Not sure what topic to choose? Try out the 'Load Sample Quiz' feature! This gives you a pre-made quiz to explore.
QuizMEGPT aims to make learning fun and engaging, allowing you to test your knowledge and learn new information across a wide array of topics. Enjoy the quiz experience!

Note: While ChatGPT strives to provide accurate information, there might be instances where the generated content may be incorrect or out-of-date. We're constantly working on improving the accuracy of the system. However, it's important to remember that the underlying model was last trained on new data in September 2021, and thus it doesn't have information about the world after that point. We encourage users to use QuizMEGPT as a fun learning tool rather than a primary source of information and to verify any important data from other reliable resources. Thank you for your understanding and enjoy the quizzes!

Mainly written in Vue.js and Firebase for backend, hosted in Firebase.
